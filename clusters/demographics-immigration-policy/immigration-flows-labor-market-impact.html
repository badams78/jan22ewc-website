            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on quantitative analysis of immigration patterns and their direct economic consequences, particularly labor market effects. Articles examine specific immigration programs like H-1B visas, border enforcement data, asylum policies, and workforce demographics. Common sources include government statistics (Border Patrol encounters, CPS data), policy institute analyses (AEI, Pew Research), and economic impact studies measuring productivity gains, fiscal costs, and skill-level distributions. The content emphasizes data-driven assessments of immigration's net economic effects across education levels. Unlike its sibling subcluster on fertility and family structures, this group concentrates on cross-border migration flows and immediate labor market integration rather than long-term demographic transitions within populations.</p>
