            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the global phenomenon of declining fertility rates and evolving family structures across developed and developing nations. Articles focus on demographic statistics showing dramatic fertility drops in countries like South Korea and the US, changing marriage and cohabitation patterns, and rising single populations among young adults. Content draws from census data, longitudinal demographic studies, and economic forecasts projecting population shifts. Key themes include delayed family formation due to financial instability, the retreat from traditional family structures, and long-term societal implications of depopulating societies. The analysis spans regional variations from sub-Saharan Africa's continued growth to East Asia's demographic collapse, emphasizing economic and policy challenges these trends present.</p>
