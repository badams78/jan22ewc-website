            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines tax policy mechanisms affecting high-income individuals and their actual tax burden contributions. Articles analyze effective tax rates, inheritance levies, international tax structures, and policy reforms like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Common sources include tax policy researchers, think tank analyses, wealth surveys from UBS and similar institutions, and academic studies quantifying billionaire and top-400 earner tax payments. The focus centers on policy instruments and their implementation rather than static wealth measurement. Unlike sibling subclusters tracking wealth concentration trends over time, these articles evaluate the fiscal policy tools designed to capture revenue from high earners and debate their effectiveness, fairness, and economic impacts.</p>
