            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines generational and gender divides in political preferences, focusing on how age and sex correlate with voting patterns, party support, and policy positions. Articles frequently cite polling data from sources like Pew, WSJ-NORC, and electoral surveys, analyzing demographic breakdowns of political attitudes. Key themes include the emerging gender gap among young voters, religious differences between men and women, and generational shifts in conservative-liberal identification. Unlike its sibling subcluster on voter demographics and electoral shifts, which emphasizes broader population movements and election outcomes, this cluster specifically isolates age and gender as primary analytical variables for understanding political behavior and attitude formation.</p>
