            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the competitive landscape in drone technology and aerospace manufacturing between the US and China. Articles focus on military drone capabilities, commercial UAV market dominance, aircraft manufacturing competition between Boeing and Airbus, and emerging defense contractors like Anduril challenging traditional suppliers. Content draws from defense industry analysis, battlefield reports from Ukraine, corporate earnings data, and government program updates like DoD's Replicator initiative. Unlike sibling clusters focusing on supply chain materials or trade policies, this subcluster emphasizes end-product competition in aerial platforms and autonomous systems, tracking both established aerospace giants and disruptive startups reshaping defense procurement through innovative technologies.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions autonomous technology (which could loosely relate to drone autonomy), it specifically focuses on self-driving cars and AI limitations rather than drone technology or aerospace competition between nations. The article would be better suited for the "AI Performance Plateaus and Diminishing Returns" cluster since it directly addresses the gap between AI investment and actual capabilities, highlighting the diminishing returns on autonomous driving technology development.</div>
