            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intensifying maritime competition between major powers, particularly the US-China rivalry in naval capabilities and shipbuilding capacity. Articles analyze shipbuilding output statistics, naval procurement programs like the Constellation-class frigate, defense spending as percentage of GDP, and strategic partnerships among allies. Coverage includes trade policy measures affecting maritime industries, sanctions on shipbuilders, and infrastructure constraints at major ports. Unlike sibling clusters focused on specific technologies or supply chains, this subcluster emphasizes traditional military hardware production capacity and sea power projection capabilities that underpin broader geopolitical competition.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions supply constraints for high-voltage cables, it focuses on renewable energy infrastructure rather than naval shipbuilding or maritime military competition between major powers.
