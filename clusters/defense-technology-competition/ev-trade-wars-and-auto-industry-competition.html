            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intensifying global competition in electric vehicle markets, particularly between Chinese manufacturers and Western automakers. Articles analyze Chinese EV export growth, market share battles, and the automotive industry's transformation from traditional manufacturing to electronics-driven production. Coverage includes trade policy responses like EU tariffs on Chinese EVs, supply chain restructuring, and technological developments in battery technology. Data sources emphasize sales figures, market share statistics, and employment impacts across major automotive regions. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on semiconductors or defense spending, this group specifically targets consumer automotive markets and the geopolitical implications of China's rapid EV industry expansion.</p>
