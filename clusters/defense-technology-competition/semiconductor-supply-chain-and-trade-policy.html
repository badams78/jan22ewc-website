            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of semiconductor technology and international trade policy within the broader US-China strategic competition. Articles focus on chip export controls, supply chain security, and manufacturing capacity building, particularly around advanced AI processors like Nvidia's H200 and Blackwell chips. Coverage includes policy shifts under different administrations, Chinese responses to restrictions, and European nations' regulatory decisions regarding companies like Nexperia. Sources range from industry analysis and government announcements to executive statements and market intelligence reports. The content emphasizes economic statecraft through technology controls, domestic manufacturing initiatives, and the global race for semiconductor self-sufficiency, distinguishing itself through detailed examination of specific chips, companies, and policy mechanisms rather than broader defense applications.</p>
