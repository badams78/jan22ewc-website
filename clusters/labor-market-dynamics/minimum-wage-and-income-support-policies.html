            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines government interventions in labor markets through minimum wage policies and income support programs. Articles analyze policy impacts using empirical data from sources like CBO, CPS, and HUD, featuring randomized experiments, statistical analyses, and case studies of specific jurisdictions. Common themes include trade-offs between wage increases and employment effects, welfare program utilization, tax credit systems, and unconditional cash transfer experiments. Unlike sibling clusters focusing on organic wage trends or employment patterns, this subcluster specifically evaluates deliberate policy interventions and their economic consequences on low-income households and labor market outcomes.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses government income support policies (tax subsidies for families), it focuses specifically on how the tax system differentially treats families with and without children rather than examining minimum wage policies or broader income support programs for low-wage workers. The content is more closely aligned with family policy and tax policy than with labor market interventions, which explains why it has higher similarity to the fertility/family structure cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses a government income support program (Pandemic Unemployment Assistance), it focuses primarily on fraud detection and financial losses rather than analyzing the policy design, labor market impacts, or effectiveness of the income support mechanism itself. The article's emphasis on audit findings and fiscal waste aligns more closely with government spending analysis than with the typical policy evaluation approach of the minimum wage and income support cluster.</div>
