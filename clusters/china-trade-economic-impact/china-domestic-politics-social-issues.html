            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines China's internal political dynamics, military affairs, and social challenges rather than external trade relationships. Articles focus on CCP leadership changes, military promotions and purges, youth unemployment crises, content censorship policies, and anti-corruption campaigns involving detention of officials. Coverage includes government statistics on unemployment, reports on Party plenum attendance, and analysis of domestic policy responses to social issues. Unlike the trade-focused sibling subcluster analyzing export data and surplus figures, this collection emphasizes China's internal governance struggles, demographic challenges, and political control mechanisms that indirectly impact economic performance.</p>
