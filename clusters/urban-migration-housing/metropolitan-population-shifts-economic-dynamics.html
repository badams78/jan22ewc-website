            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the economic forces driving population movements within and between major US metropolitan areas. Articles analyze domestic migration patterns, particularly outflows from high-cost cities like NYC and California, using census data and employment statistics to understand workforce mobility trends. Content focuses on job growth patterns, wage dynamics, and how economic opportunities shape residential choices across different metropolitan regions. Unlike its sibling subcluster on Housing Affordability & Market Pricing Trends, which emphasizes real estate costs and market mechanisms, this collection prioritizes labor market conditions, demographic shifts, and broader economic indicators as primary drivers of urban population changes and regional competitiveness.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S10</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions NYC (a major metropolitan area) and involves significant public spending ($773m), the core focus is on educational policy and school intervention programs rather than population movements or economic forces driving migration patterns within metropolitan areas. The content aligns much better with educational interventions, as evidenced by the higher similarity score (0.57) to the K-12 education cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P12_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions Palm Beach real estate values, it lacks the core elements of metropolitan population analysis - there's no discussion of migration patterns, population movements, or the economic dynamics driving people to move between metro areas. The article reads more like a straightforward real estate market report than an analysis of demographic shifts and their underlying economic causes.</div>
