            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of climate-related risks and property insurance markets, focusing on how natural disasters and extreme weather events are destabilizing traditional homeowners insurance models. Articles analyze insurer financial performance data, regulatory filings, and catastrophe bond markets to track premium increases, coverage cancellations, and company insolvencies across climate-vulnerable states like Florida. Content includes WSJ analyses of insurer ratings, reinsurer loss estimates, and Congressional disaster relief funding patterns. Unlike sibling subclusters examining broader housing affordability or demographic shifts, this cluster specifically addresses insurance market mechanics and climate adaptation policies, including innovative responses like Florida's proposed property tax reforms as alternatives to traditional coverage models.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions Florida's declining home prices (which could be climate-related given Florida's exposure to hurricanes and flooding), it focuses primarily on general housing market pricing trends and explicitly argues that Florida's situation won't spread nationally due to state-specific factors, rather than examining the specific relationship between climate risks and property insurance markets. The content aligns more closely with broader housing market analysis than with the insurance crisis and climate risk intersection that defines this cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions wildfire damage costs (a climate-related risk), it focuses narrowly on a single cost estimate rather than examining the broader impacts on property insurance markets or how such disasters are destabilizing traditional homeowners insurance. The article's emphasis on quantifying financial losses from a specific event aligns more with general market pricing discussions than with the cluster's focus on systemic insurance market disruptions caused by climate risks.</div>
