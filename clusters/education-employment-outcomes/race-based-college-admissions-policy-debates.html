            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines race-conscious admissions policies and related educational equity debates, featuring survey data on public opinion toward affirmative action, enrollment statistics by racial demographics, and policy proposals affecting selective programs. Articles typically draw from polling organizations like Pew Research, institutional enrollment data, and academic studies analyzing admission outcomes. Unlike sibling clusters focused on academic performance metrics or labor market returns, this subcluster specifically addresses the contentious intersection of race, merit, and access in educational selection processes, encompassing everything from kindergarten gifted programs to elite university admissions and military academy integration policies.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves educational policy that may have racial equity implications (gifted programs often have demographic disparities), it primarily focuses on a specific K-12 program elimination proposal rather than explicitly discussing race-based admissions policies or affirmative action debates.
