            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of educational attainment and romantic partnership patterns, focusing on how gender disparities in college completion affect marriage and dating markets. Articles analyze demographic trends using institutional data from sources like Bank of America, Danish administrative records, and longitudinal surveys spanning decades. The research reveals how educational sorting influences mate selection, with particular attention to declining marriage rates among non-college populations and changing gender dynamics in higher education. Unlike sibling clusters that focus on academic performance metrics or workplace wage premiums, this subcluster specifically explores how educational achievements translate into relationship outcomes and family formation patterns across different demographic groups.</p>
