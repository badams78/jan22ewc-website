            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the evolving relationship between college education and labor market outcomes, particularly focusing on employment rates and wage premiums for recent graduates. Articles analyze unemployment statistics, enrollment trends, and the diminishing value of college degrees in securing well-paying employment. Common data sources include Bureau of Labor Statistics employment figures, college enrollment statistics, and wage surveys comparing degree holders to non-graduates. The content primarily features quantitative economic analysis and policy commentary. Unlike sibling subclusters examining academic performance metrics or generational wealth patterns, this cluster specifically targets the immediate post-graduation transition period and questions whether higher education investments yield expected returns in today's job market.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "College Graduate Employment & Wage Premiums" cluster because it focuses on the unintended consequences of Ireland's free college policy on university quality and international rankings, rather than directly examining employment outcomes or wage premiums for graduates. While the article touches on higher education policy, it doesn't analyze the core labor market outcomes that define this cluster, making it only tangentially related to the subcluster's focus on graduate employment and earnings.</div>
