            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on standardized test results and educational assessment data that measure student academic achievement across different grade levels and demographics. Articles predominantly analyze findings from major assessment programs like NAEP, PISA, and OECD surveys, documenting trends in reading and math proficiency, learning loss patterns, and international comparisons of educational outcomes. The content typically reports quantitative data showing declining test scores, achievement gaps, and concerning statistics about student performance below grade level. Coverage includes both national trends and state-by-state variations, often highlighting partisan differences in educational outcomes. Unlike broader education policy discussions, this subcluster specifically examines measurable learning outcomes through formal assessment data.</p>
