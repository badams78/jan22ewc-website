            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the direct economic returns to cognitive abilities and intelligence measures in labor markets. Articles analyze longitudinal datasets from birth cohorts, military aptitude tests, and twin studies to quantify how cognitive skills translate into wages and career outcomes. Research focuses on measurable intelligence metrics like IQ scores, general mental ability tests, and standardized assessments, exploring their predictive power for earnings across different demographics and time periods. Unlike sibling subclusters that examine institutional factors like college admissions or broad educational attainment gaps, this collection specifically isolates cognitive capability as an independent variable driving economic success, often controlling for educational credentials to identify the pure returns to mental ability.</p>
