            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines how educational attainment shapes employment outcomes, earnings trajectories, and broader socioeconomic well-being. Articles analyze labor force participation rates, wage gaps, and career prospects across education levels, particularly focusing on non-college workers' declining opportunities and social status. Research draws from longitudinal employment data, international comparative studies, and demographic surveys spanning 1980-2024. Unlike sibling clusters examining academic performance metrics or generational wealth patterns, this subcluster specifically connects educational credentials to labor market realities, exploring how technological change, geographic factors, and economic restructuring create divergent outcomes for college versus non-college populations in employment rates, job quality, and social mobility.</p>
