            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines persistent educational achievement and attainment disparities between racial and ethnic groups, particularly focusing on Black-white gaps in academic outcomes and their downstream economic effects. Articles frequently cite research by economists like Raj Chetty analyzing intergenerational mobility patterns, tax filing data, and employment statistics to document how educational differences translate into wage and career disparities. Unlike sibling clusters examining general academic performance or broad labor market trends, this subcluster specifically isolates race and ethnicity as key variables, exploring whether gaps stem from structural barriers, skill differences, or discriminatory practices across educational and employment systems.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions race and touches on systemic racism, it focuses on a philosophical/political debate about agency and historical anti-racism efforts rather than examining actual educational achievement gaps, graduation rates, or academic outcome disparities between racial groups.
