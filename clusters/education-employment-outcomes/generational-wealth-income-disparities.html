            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines intergenerational economic differences, focusing on wealth accumulation, income growth patterns, and financial outcomes across generational cohorts (Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X). Articles predominantly analyze Federal Reserve wealth data, labor statistics, and demographic economic trends to compare how different generations fare at similar life stages. Common themes include student debt burdens, homeownership affordability, wage growth disparities, and workforce participation rates. Unlike sibling subclusters that focus on educational achievement metrics or workplace management effectiveness, this cluster specifically tracks long-term economic mobility and wealth-building capacity across age cohorts, often revealing how economic conditions during formative years shape lifetime financial trajectories.</p>
