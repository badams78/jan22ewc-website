            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the economic returns and admissions processes of elite higher education institutions, with particular focus on standardized testing requirements and their predictive value. Articles typically analyze longitudinal datasets from Ivy-Plus colleges and selective universities, investigating how SAT/ACT scores correlate with academic outcomes and lifetime earnings. The research explores policy changes in test-optional admissions, differential returns by demographic groups, and the relationship between student quality metrics and institutional selectivity. Unlike sibling clusters focusing on broader educational attainment gaps or K-12 interventions, this subcluster specifically targets the intersection of elite college access, standardized assessment validity, and socioeconomic mobility through prestigious institution attendance.</p>
