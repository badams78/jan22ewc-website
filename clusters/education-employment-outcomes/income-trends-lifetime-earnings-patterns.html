            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines long-term earnings trajectories and income distribution patterns across demographic groups and time periods. Articles analyze wage trends spanning decades, focusing on how earnings evolve over workers' careers and lifetimes rather than single-point measurements. Common themes include prime-age earnings patterns, peak earning ages, income quintile mobility, and generational wealth accumulation. Data sources typically draw from longitudinal datasets like Federal Reserve surveys and Bureau of Labor Statistics records. Unlike sibling clusters examining educational attainment gaps or academic performance metrics, this subcluster emphasizes economic outcomes over time, tracking how income patterns shift across age cohorts and socioeconomic strata throughout working careers.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses men's earnings trends over time (1979-2021), which fits the income patterns theme, its primary focus is on how these earnings relate to marriage and family formation rather than analyzing the earnings trajectories themselves. The content is more aligned with examining gender-specific economic factors affecting marriage outcomes, which explains why it shows higher similarity to the "Gender Gaps in Education & Marriage Outcomes" cluster.</div>
