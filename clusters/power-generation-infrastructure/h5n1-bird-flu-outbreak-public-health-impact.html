            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak and its escalating public health implications, tracking viral transmission across species barriers from birds to livestock and humans. Articles predominantly cite CDC data, WHO reports, and epidemiological studies, documenting infection rates in dairy herds, human cases, and emerging viral variants like D1.1. Coverage emphasizes surveillance data, serologic surveys, and genomic sequencing results. Unlike sibling subclusters examining energy infrastructure and scientific breakthroughs, this group addresses immediate biosecurity threats and disease containment challenges, representing a critical intersection of agricultural economics and pandemic preparedness within broader infrastructure resilience discussions.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the H5N1 Bird Flu cluster because while it involves an infectious disease outbreak with animal-to-human transmission (bat consumption), it describes an unidentified illness in the Democratic Republic of Congo rather than the H5N1 avian influenza strain that defines the cluster.

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses primarily on the agricultural and economic impact of bird culls rather than the public health implications that define the cluster's core theme.
