            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines water scarcity, distribution challenges, and infrastructure responses across major economies. Articles analyze regional water depletion patterns, groundwater reserve decline, and climate-induced supply stress, particularly in the US Southwest and China. Content draws from federal analyses, economic impact assessments, and policy announcements regarding water allocation agreements and pricing mechanisms. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on energy production or technological breakthroughs, this cluster emphasizes resource constraints and adaptive management strategies, including massive infrastructure investments like China's Yarlung Tsangpo dam project that bridges water security with power generation objectives.</p>
